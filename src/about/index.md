### **Uncovering Genetic Factors in Kidney Fibrosis Progression**

Kidney fibrosis can progress differently among patients, even with the same underlying disease. To improve early diagnosis and prediction, our research focuses on identifying the **genetic factors** driving these differences.

* Identifying 

  **transcription and regulatory factors**

   linked to fibrosis progression in different genetic backgrounds using 

  **diabetes and ureter obstruction models;**
* Investigating these factors in 

  **cell models**

   and assessing their role in fibrosis-related gene expression using 

  **siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9;**
* Studying the effects of 

  **overexpressing transcription factors**

   in primary and HK2 kidney cells;
* Exploring how 

  **autophagy influences fibrosis progression**

   through in vitro and in vivo experiments;
* **Validating findings**

   using human kidney biopsy samples from FSGS and diabetic patients

By integrating **genetic and molecular approaches**, we aim to uncover new pathways and treatment options for kidney fibrosis.

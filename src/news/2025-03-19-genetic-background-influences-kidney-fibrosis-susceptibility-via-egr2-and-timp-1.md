Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progresses at different rates in patients, influenced by genetic factors that remain largely unknown. Our study, published in the prestigious *Kidney International*, explores how genetic background affects kidney fibrosis progression, focusing on the roles of early growth response-2 (EGR2) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1).

Using transgenic mice overexpressing TGF-β1, we compared fibrosis development in different genetic strains, specifically C57Bl6 (B6) and CBAxB6 hybrids. We found that CBAxB6-TGFβ mice developed severe kidney fibrosis and early mortality, whereas B6-TGFβ mice exhibited only mild fibrosis with prolonged survival. The key difference was an early and significant upregulation of EGR2 and TIMP-1 in the fibrosis-prone strain, leading to reduced matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) activity and excessive extracellular matrix accumulation.

Further analysis in unilateral ureter obstruction (UUO) and subtotal nephrectomy (SNX) models confirmed that fibrosis-prone strains showed early EGR2 and TIMP-1 activation. In vivo TIMP-1 neutralization reduced fibrosis severity, while in vitro experiments demonstrated that EGR2 overexpression upregulated TIMP-1, reinforcing their role in fibrotic progression.

Crucially, our findings extend beyond animal models. Human kidney biopsies from patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) also displayed elevated EGR2 and TIMP-1 levels, suggesting that these molecular pathways are relevant to human kidney disease.

These results suggest that genetic predisposition to kidney fibrosis may be mediated by early EGR2 and TIMP-1 responses, making them potential targets for future therapeutic interventions.

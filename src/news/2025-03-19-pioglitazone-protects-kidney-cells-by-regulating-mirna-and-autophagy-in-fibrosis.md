Chronic kidney disease (CKD) often progresses to fibrosis, with no effective treatments currently available. Our study, published in International Journal of Molecular Sciences, investigates how the PPARγ agonist pioglitazone (Pio) impacts kidney fibrosis by regulating miRNA expression and autophagy dysfunction.



We used in vitro and in vivo models, including primary mouse tubular epithelial cells and TGF-β transgenic mice, to explore the effects of pioglitazone. Our results demonstrate that Pio reduces TGF-β-induced fibrosis by suppressing key pro-fibrotic markers (e.g., COL1A1, TGFB1, and CTGF) and restoring normal miRNA expression, particularly miR-130a and miR-199a, which are associated with fibrosis progression. Additionally, Pio improves autophagy function by restoring the LC3-II/I ratio and reducing SQSTM1 accumulation, thereby counteracting the damaging effects of fibrosis.



Moreover, pioglitazone significantly decreased inflammation-related genes (IL6, CCL2, and C3), supporting its potential as an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic therapeutic agent. These findings suggest that PPARγ activation could be a promising strategy for managing kidney fibrosis by targeting both autophagy and miRNA dysregulation.

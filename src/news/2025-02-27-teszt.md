Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing global health challenge, often leading to kidney fibrosis, a process lacking effective therapeutic options. Our recent study, published in *International Journal of Molecular Sciences*, investigates the role of renal epithelial complement C3 in fibrosis progression.

We used a unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model in genetically distinct mouse strains with varying fibrosis susceptibility. Our findings highlight that fibrosis-prone strains exhibit early and heightened renal C3 expression, which correlates with accelerated fibrotic progression. *In vitro* experiments further demonstrated that C3a receptor activation in renal tubular epithelial cells drives inflammatory and pro-fibrotic responses, independent of conventional TGFÎ² pathways.

Importantly, human focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) kidney biopsies also showed elevated C3 expression, suggesting a potential role of local complement activation in human kidney fibrosis. These findings underscore the importance of complement-targeted therapies for managing CKD progression.

Our study, published in *Histochemistry and Cell Biology*, explores how different cell culture medium formulations impact the response of human renal proximal tubular epithelial HK-2 cells to Transforming Growth Factor-Beta (TGF-β), a key regulator of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and kidney fibrosis.

We examined six widely used medium formulations and found that TGF-β1 consistently increased the expression of key pro-fibrotic genes (e.g., ACTA2, TGFB1, COL4A1, and CTGF), but the expression of other markers like EGR1, IL6, and complement C3 varied depending on the medium. Protein expression and cellular morphology also differed, demonstrating that growth conditions significantly influence experimental outcomes.

These findings emphasize the importance of carefully selecting cell culture media for EMT and fibrosis research to ensure reliable and reproducible results.
